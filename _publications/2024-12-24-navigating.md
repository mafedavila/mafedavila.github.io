excerpt: 'In this paper, we survey the state of the art in Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) and examine user needs by defining a set of functional and non-functional requirements. We also evaluate the reported performance of 37 TDS research tools on these requirements, develop a tool selection guide to help users find a suitable TDS tool for their use case, and identify open challenges in TDS research, especially with respect to data management.'
