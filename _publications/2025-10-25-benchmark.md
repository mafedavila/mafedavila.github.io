excerpt: 'This study presents a benchmark for tabular data synthesis (TDS) tools, evaluating their performance across six critical dimensions: handling dataset imbalance, dataset augmentation, handling missing values, privacy, machine learning (ML) utility, and computational performance. Our findings provide practical insights to guide tool selection based on specific use cases and constraints. We assessed 13 tools across 15 datasets from different use cases, focusing on prosumer hardware configurations for end-users and highlight the trade-offs among various TDS models. '
