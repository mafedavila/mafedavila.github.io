I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Oldenburg, specializing in tabular data synthesis with deep generative models. With a Master’s degree in Renewable Energies and a Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering, I combine a strong technical foundation with expertise in data analysis, energy efficiency, and sustainability. Over the past years, I have worked with large manufacturing companies, developing digital tools to optimize resource and energy consumption and sustainability. My passion lies in bridging computer science and mechanical engineering to drive the industry forward.
